# Deep Learning
EE-559 Deep learning course at EPFL

## Project 1:
The objective of this project is to train a predictor of finger movements from Electroencephalography
(EEG) recordings.

Data Set 4: of the “BCI competition II” organized in May 2003 (Benjamin Blankertz and
M¨uller, 2002).

http://www.bbci.de/competition/ii/

It is composed of 316 training recordings, and 100 test recordings, each composed of 28 EEG channels
sampled at 1khz for 0.5s.

The goal is to predict the laterality of upcoming finger movements (left vs. right hand) 130 ms before
key-press.

test.py is an executable for each project, that show the work we did
