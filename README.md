# Deep Learning
EE-559 Deep learning course at EPFL

# Project 1:
The objective of this project is to train a predictor of finger movements from Electroencephalography
(EEG) recordings.

# Project 2:
The objective of this project is to design a mini “deep learning framework” using only pytorch’s
tensor operations and the standard math library, hence in particular without using autograd or the
neural-network modules.

#### NB:
test.py is an executable for each project, that show the work we did
